This repo has SAS scripts for analyzing experimental design data. It focuses on statistical modeling and treatment effects using generalized linear models (GLM) and factorial design analysis.

## Key Features

- GLM implementation for treatment effects analysis.
- Simulates and analyzes factorial design data.
- Generates diagnostic and normal probability plots.
- Creates PDF reports via SAS ODS for result visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Must have SAS software installed and licensed.

### Quick Run

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/experimental_design.git
    cd experimental_design
    ```

2. Open SAS and load either `FInalProject.sas` or `MidtermProject.sas`.

3. Run the scripts. Adjust output file paths in scripts as needed; reports are generated automatically.

### Gotchas

- Ensure proper permissions on output directories.
- Script paths may need customization for your setup.
